Overall feedback: the team outlined specific project plan. Discussed EDA and proposed modeling techniques in detail.

Introduction: Nice intro! for the second bullet point: cite one-two papers here. 
EDA: split this slide into 2-3 slides (i.e., write only 1-2 ideas per slide). 
EDA-features and top correlated features: very nice summary of the data
Preprocessing: looks good!
Prediction algorithms: Focus on three algos of your choice and if you have extra time, do all of them. Identify your baseline model (you probably mentioned and I didnâ€™t understand).
Model evaluation: looks good!
Anything else to recommend? If you can, try to use less text for your slides. Rely more on images/figures
