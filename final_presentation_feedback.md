•	Title, Authors: yes

•	(15%) Motivation: the team cited two papers (nice!). Mentioned about the models they run from very beginning (very nice!).

•	(15%) Data: EDA: the team identified they are working with a small, highly unbalanced dataset (nice!). Summary stats: unidentified features but the team plotted the distributions. Preprocessing: standard ML techniques + feature extraction (good! PCA and tSNE)

•	(15%) Approach: Baseline model: predict the majority class (good choice). Improvement: Decision trees (there is a bug in the ROC AUC point, right now it’s showing only two datapoints). Random Forests (the best accuracy achieved so far). LR (highlighted that validation is below training curve (nice!) – the team tried to improve by training a FFNN. Team discussed fairness using subgroups information (very nice!)

•	(30%) Experiments: the team has executed lots of experiments (hyperparameter tuning) for each model

•	(10%) Conclusions: mentioned that RF is the winning, and also mentioned what they could do for future work

•	(15%) Code submission: yes, and well organized

•	Contributions: yes

•	General comment: the team’s presentation was very organized and easy to follow (this is a good skill to have!). I also very much liked that the team looked into fairness.
